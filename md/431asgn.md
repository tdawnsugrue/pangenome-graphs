## Abstract

- ~ 1-200 words summarising the introduction, and the contents of the paper

## Introduction

- Brief overview on the importance of serving informational needs
- Specific database type/s
    - challenges that come with video archives
        - harder to summarise; harder to parse unlike text-based
- Brief intro on query generation
    - and how it can be used to assist in meeting users info needs
        - link prompting paper
        - and maybe 2012 paper...
- Intro the 3 papers; 1 sentence each.

## Paper 1

- What research questions did they set out
    - reiterate the video archive thing
- An overview of what they did
    - big-picture
    - how they did it (broadly what technologies; add in math explanation if need to pad)
- Their contribution to the field
    - made a thing to more easily search video archives by providing 'questions' and timestamps where subject of q is a'd
- briefly, some shortcomings
    - anything addressed in future research section

## Paper 2

Generating Clarifying Questions for Information Retrieval
- ababa

## Paper 3

- doc2query
(could also do doc2query--, which paper A is built on)
- what research questions did this paper have
    - NN-based *document* (not query) expansion?
        - note this is fairly early; pre-that ai boom c. 2021
    - as an alternative to reranking
        - reasonable? tradeoff of spd vs performance
- how this relates to paper A
    - it's the model that paper A is built on; adapted for video archive
        - why good for video?
- what was done
    - what tool did they build, what technologies were used to develop it
- contribution to the field
- shortcomings ()
