### General Notes
- Due May 6?
- Approx 2k words
- Worth 15% (weighted less for initial submission)
- Shape & scope can be discussed; what to in/exclude, formulation of aims also w/ supervisor. Just not the writing itself

#### Content as per guidelines
- brief lit review
- rationale behind 'plan of action' (note: this may not be as clear-cut as we're working more data-first?)
- Main aims of the project for ~1/2 page at end of introduction
- Consider including figures if/where necessary

### General Structure

**I don't particularly like this. Alter/Rewrite later**
(refer to original proposal and also )

- General Background in pangenomes
	- Motivation; why pangenomes?
	- Brief overview of how current tools compare with linear-based tools
	- Any recent developments to a.) show *why* these are good
		- Both tools-based and use-case studies (where pangenomes have been used in a useful application in something published)
		- Also any highlighting pitfalls
	- Extant shortcomings
- Introduction to the thesis work
	- What's being investigated
		- Investigated mapping 
			- (do we want to also compare to linear-based tools? May be interesting to compare the two pipelines...)
		- Visualisation
			- Why visualisation
			- The challenges of visualising graphs (vs linear)
			- State of current tools
				- Bandage, sequenceTubeMaps, etc.
			- and THEREFORE what/why we're investigating
				- adding something that's missing
				- having something that's less complete ass to work with.
