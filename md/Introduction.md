### General Notes
- Due May 6?
- Approx 2k words
- Worth 15% (weighted less for initial submission)
- Shape & scope can be discussed; what to in/exclude, formulation of aims also w/ supervisor. Just not the writing itself

#### Content as per guidelines
- brief lit review
- rationale behind 'plan of action' (note: this may not be as clear-cut as we're working more data-first?)
- Main aims of the project for ~1/2 page at end of introduction
- Consider including figures if/where necessary

### General Structure

(copied from book; fri apr 26)

- the motivating problem
	- describe hg38; where it's used (ubiquitously); why it's used (1-2 good sentences)
		- define linear-based genome
	- some specific problems w/ hg38 and/or linear-based references in general
		- issues with diversity (be specific)
			- where hg38 comes from (1 individual of european ancestry)
			- SVs? [GET LITERATURE FOR THIS + other issues]
- Introduction to pangenomes:
	- Describe what a pangenome is & how it differs from a linear-based reference
		- What are the benefits of this? Especially wrt known problems with linear
			- Give specific examples + ref. how pangenomes have worked to solve some of these [CHECK PRC papers for src/starting point]
		- What are some current known issues of pangenomes?
			- Unsolved problems from linear (can probaby leave this out of introduction esp. if not relevant)
			- *this is a lead-in to thesis topic* -->
-  Issues of adoption
	- There's a cost associated with switching to new workflows: see people still using hg37 (any source for this? would be useful)
		- Needs to be worth the cost; new tools need to be available (or old ones need to be adapted to work with graph-based)
	- To that end, we are:
		- a.) doing an assessment of the state of (some) of the tools currently available for graph-based genomes
			- is this comparative?
		- b.) looking at mapping (?)
			- why this is/may be a challenge with graph-based over linear genomes
			- what specifically we're looking ay
			- (I think I had something here but had to help a student and lost my train of thought..)
		- c.) looking at visualisation tools
			- challenges w/ visualisation
			- graphs with large SVs can be confusing to look at
			- challenging to make a readable graph with larger segments of the reference (ref [link goes here])
			- to that end: looking at the state of current tools
				- investigating avenues to improve visualisation
					- (Q: how do we assess this quantitatively? If it's something no tool can do yet, should be easy but if we're *improving* something this may be tricky?)
- Some less specific (but not *too* vague) overarching statement on the overall goals of what's being done here; and to what benefit.
